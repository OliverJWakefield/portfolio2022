        <p>During my time at St Johns, I supported 19+ year old males with severe learning difficulties such as Autism

            This job entailed supporting the learners in the community, building their independence and social skills
            to help in their future lives to live independently and to support themselves.
            During my time in this role, I developed skills and a passion for working with others and helping them
            resolve the issues they faced day to day.
            At times the role was challenging and involved working in a high stress environment, which was incredibly
            rewarding and taught me a great deal about how to handle intense problems others face and most
            importantly for me personally was I gained an understanding of the value of putting others before myself.</p>
